# Configuration

CSW reads `.claude/csw.json` from the repo you are working in. Every key is optional; the
defaults below apply when the file or the key is absent. From a linked worktree, CSW also
looks in the main worktree's root, so the file works whether or not it is committed.

Inspect what CSW actually sees:

```bash
csw-config json          # the effective config
csw-config get validate  # one value
csw-config path          # which file it read, if any
```

## Keys

| Key | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `ticketPrefix` | `""` | Prefix added to a bare number, so `/csw:work 1088` becomes `TRA-1088`. Leave empty and bare numbers are rejected as ambiguous. |
| `tracker` | `"none"` | `linear` (via MCP), `github` (via `gh`), or `none` (paste the ticket text). |
| `trackerCommand` | `""` | `/csw:batch` **only**: a command printing the candidate array on stdout, instead of reading the tracker. Must be read-only. Does not replace `tracker`. See below. |
| `baseBranch` | `"main"` | What PRs target, what "merged" is measured against, and where cleanup returns to. |
| `defaultType` | `"feat"` | Conventional-commit type used when the ticket gives no signal. |
| `validate` | `""` | The one command that must pass before a PR opens. Empty means the repo declared none, and CSW will say so rather than guess. |
| `baseline` | `""` | A cheap command `/csw:work` runs at Step 1.5, in the main checkout, before it claims the ticket or opens a worktree. Its subject is the environment, not the change. Empty means the repo declared none and the step never runs. See below. |
| `worktreeDir` | `".worktrees"` | Where fallback worktrees go. Must be gitignored. Ignored when a native worktree tool is available. |
| `branchPattern` | `"<type>/<ticket>-<slug>"` | Branch name template. Tokens: `<type>`, `<ticket>` (lowercased), `<slug>` (from the title, max 40 chars). |
| `adrDir` | `""` | Where this repo keeps its architecture decision records, e.g. `docs/adr`. Non-empty and `/csw:work` asks, once, whether the run produced a decision that outlives its ticket. Empty and it never asks. See below. |
| `gates` | `[]` | Extra validation triggered by which files changed. See below. |
| `batch.maxTickets` | `3` | Cap on a single `/csw:batch` run. |
| `batch.singleWriterLabels` | `["migration"]` | Labels admitting at most one ticket per batch. |

`csw-config json` prints the full merged object, defaults and all — the table above is a
key-by-key reading of that same output, not a separate description.

## Ticket references

`ticketPrefix` must start with a letter and contain only letters and digits after that
(`TRA`, `ENG`, `K8S` are all valid). `csw-ticket` accepts a bare number, a dashed reference
(`tra-1088`, `K8S-42`), or an undashed one when the prefix is pure letters (`tra1088`). An
undashed reference where the prefix itself contains digits (`k8s42`) is genuinely ambiguous
about where the prefix ends and the ticket number begins, so it is rejected rather than
guessed.

### Ticket references and `tracker: github`

`ticketPrefix` exists for trackers whose keys look like `ENG-1088`. GitHub has no such
prefix — issues are numbered per repository, so the number alone already identifies one.

With `"tracker": "github"` and no `ticketPrefix`, a bare number is therefore a valid
reference and normalises to itself, and a leading `#` is accepted and stripped:

```bash
csw-ticket normalize 68     # -> 68
csw-ticket normalize '#68'  # -> 68
csw-ticket branch feat 68 'Add the prep pass'
# -> feat/68-add-the-prep-pass
```

Set `ticketPrefix` alongside `tracker: github` and it still applies, so `68` becomes
`GH-68` if that is what you want.

Every other tracker keeps the strict rule: with no `ticketPrefix`, a bare number does not
identify anything and is rejected with exit 2. That is deliberate — silently guessing which
project a number belongs to is worse than refusing.

## `trackerCommand`

An escape hatch for people who would rather shell out to a CLI, or to their own GraphQL query,
than have an agent talk to the tracker. Empty — the default — and nothing changes: `tracker`
decides how tickets are read.

Non-empty and `/csw:batch` Step 1 runs it as `bash -c "<string>"` from the repo root, with no
arguments and no injected environment, exactly as `validate` and `gates[].run` are run. Its
stdout is used **as-is** as the candidate array. That is the point: one call returning the
array the filter consumes, rather than several tracker calls plus reshaping across twenty
tickets in context, which is where the errors come from.

```json
"tracker": "linear",
"trackerCommand": "linear-todo --json"
```

The expected stdout is a JSON array of ticket objects:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "ENG-1075",
    "state": "Todo",
    "priority": 2,
    "labels": ["migration"],
    "blockedBy": [],
    "relatedTo": ["ENG-1080", "ENG-1081"]
  }
]
```

Only `id` is required — a non-empty string, unique across the array. `state`, `priority`,
`labels`, `blockedBy`, and `relatedTo` may each be absent or `null`, with the types above when
present. What is load-bearing in practice is `state`: it must read exactly `"Todo"` or the
ticket is dropped as "not in Todo", so a command that omits the field selects nothing at all.

Four things to know before setting it:

- **It is `/csw:batch` only.** `/csw:work` and `/csw:prep` read a single ticket, and they keep
  reading it through `tracker`. The name suggests otherwise; the scope is batch selection.
- **`tracker` still has to be correct.** `trackerCommand` replaces the fetch, not the tracker.
  Priority ordering (below) is keyed off `tracker`, so shelling out to a Linear query and
  setting `tracker: none` because MCP is no longer in play gets the wrong sort order silently.
- **A non-zero exit is a failed selection**, reported with the command's stderr verbatim, with
  nothing dispatched. Printing *nothing at all* is also a failure — a command with nothing to
  report must print `[]`, which is an empty selection. A failed selection is never an empty one.
- **It must be read-only.** `/csw:batch --dry-run` reaches Step 1 before it decides to stop, so
  a dry run does run this command. A dry run's "no side effects" promise covers what CSW does,
  not what a configured command chooses to do.

The output is not validated before use: it goes straight into `csw-batch-filter`, which exits
non-zero naming the offending field if the shape is wrong.

## `baseline`

`/csw:work` runs the repo's gate exactly once, at Step 6, after the work is done. So a machine
that was **already broken before the dispatch started** presents as a failure of the change,
twenty minutes in, with a diff layered on top of it. A dispatch cannot tell "I broke this" from
"this was already broken", because it never observed the before state.

Empty — the default — and none of this happens. There is no inference and no fallback:
guessing a baseline command has the same failure as guessing a `validate` command, which
`/csw:work` Step 0 already refuses to do.

Non-empty, and it names the command:

```json
"baseline": "pnpm run pretest"
```

`/csw:work` runs it once at **Step 1.5** — after the ticket is resolved, before Step 2 claims
it and before Step 4 opens the worktree. Green, and the dispatch says one line and proceeds.
Red, and the dispatch stops and asks, naming the command and its output: the machine was
broken before this run started, so absorbing it into a diff and meeting it again at Step 6 is
the outcome the key exists to prevent.

- **It is not a pre-run of the gate.** Reusing `validate` would double the gate on every
  dispatch, and in a repo where the gate runs twenty minutes nobody turns that on. More to the
  point, the subject is different: a stale service, a held port, a dead dependency, a
  half-applied migration are machine-level and shared, and catchable by something far cheaper
  than the full suite. A repo whose `baseline` is much narrower than its `validate` is using
  the key correctly. A green baseline is not evidence about the work, and `/csw:work` does not
  report it as partial gate coverage.
- **It runs in the main checkout, not the worktree.** A fresh worktree has no installed
  dependencies, so a baseline run inside one fails for reasons that say nothing about the
  environment — and the conditions a baseline exists to catch are machine-level anyway.
- **A failing baseline does not open a draft PR.** Step 9's draft path carries work that
  exists; at Step 1.5 nothing has been built. The ticket is not claimed either, because Step 2
  is what sets it In Progress — which is the right outcome for a failure that is not the
  ticket's fault.
- **It may mutate the machine, and that is it doing its job.** The exemplar above,
  `pnpm run pretest`, sweeps held test ports, asserts a daemon is current, and sleeps for
  hardware recovery. Repairing the environment before work starts is legitimate. Do not carry
  over `trackerCommand`'s read-only rule by analogy: that one is read-only because
  `/csw:batch --dry-run` runs it, where a side effect would be a surprise. A baseline runs
  once, deliberately, at the top of a real dispatch — closer to `validate` and `gates[].run`,
  neither of which is required to be read-only either.
- **`/csw:batch` runs it once per dispatched ticket**, all in the main checkout. That is
  accepted rather than fixed: the command is supposed to take seconds, and each dispatch
  genuinely wants to know the machine is still sane by the time its turn comes. There is no
  caching.

## `adrDir`

Build specs are disposable and get swept. Architecture decision records are the artifact that
persists — and nothing else in CSW ever asks whether a piece of work produced one. A rejected
approach, a constraint discovered the hard way, a rule the next person will otherwise re-break:
all of it lands in a PR description that nobody reads again.

Empty — the default — and none of this happens. A repo that keeps no ADRs is never asked the
question.

Non-empty, and it names the directory:

```json
"adrDir": "docs/adr"
```

`/csw:work` then asks itself, once, at its hard stop: did this run produce a decision that
outlives the ticket? Where the answer is yes it writes the ADR into that directory and pushes
it onto the pull request as its own commit, announced in the report and the PR body as
*proposed*. Where the answer is no — which is most of the time, and the expected answer — it
says nothing and stops as it always did.

- **Most tickets produce nothing durable.** An ADR per feature devalues the practice; the
  discipline is in the rarity. The prompt is a question, not a deliverable.
- **The directory supplies the convention.** CSW reads what is already there for the local
  format and to derive the next `NNNN`. An empty or absent directory falls back to
  `NNNN-kebab-title.md` with `Date:`, `Status:`, and `Tracking:` naming the tickets, then a
  `## Context` section. An unset convention is not a reason to skip the question.
- **Review is the filter, not the prompt.** Both a solo `/csw:work` and a `/csw:batch` subagent
  write the ADR. A drafted file is concrete and cheap to reject — one revert, since it is
  always its own commit — where a "candidate" line in a summary is vague and evaporates. No ADR
  reaches the base branch without the same human review as every other line of the PR.
- **Two dispatches in one night can claim the same number.** Each branches from the base and
  neither can see the other's unmerged ADR. Number from the directory at write time and let
  review renumber the second one; there is no sequencing machinery, and none is wanted.

Where an ADR is warranted, cite it from the README of the code it governs and not only from the
ADR directory — it wants to be reachable from where the mistake would be made. That is advice,
not a gate.

## Gates

A gate is a glob and a command. When a changed file matches the glob, the command joins the
validation run:

```json
"gates": [
  { "when": "**/migrations/**", "run": "just backend migrate-checksums" },
  { "when": "web/**.tsx",       "run": "just playwright-preview" }
]
```

Glob semantics:

| Pattern | Matches |
|---|---|
| `**` | Any characters, including `/` |
| `*` | Any characters except `/` |
| `?` | One character except `/` |

Patterns are anchored to the whole path, so `migrations/**` matches `migrations/0042.sql`
but not `backend/migrations/0042.sql`. Use `**/migrations/**` for the nested case.

Watch for the same trap the other way around: `web/**/*.tsx` requires a directory segment
between `web/` and the file, because the `/` between `**` and `*.tsx` is a literal character in
the pattern — it matches `web/nav/Menu.tsx` but **not** `web/Menu.tsx` directly under `web/`.
Drop the middle slash — `web/**.tsx` — to match both, since `**` can absorb the separator itself.

Gates exist for the checks CI cannot or does not run — a checksum regeneration that only
matters when a migration lands, or a browser suite that only runs against a preview
deployment.

Preview the gates a branch triggers:

```bash
csw-gates main              # committed history only
csw-gates --worktree main   # ...plus whatever is still uncommitted
```

`--worktree` is the one to reach for before a commit exists — it unions the committed diff with
the working tree and reports the gates for the tree as it will look once you commit it, so a
migration you have written but not yet added still fires its gate. Uncommitted deletions drop
out, renames and copies count as their destination, and a path containing a literal newline is
a hard error rather than a gate that quietly does not run.

`gates` must be a JSON array of objects, each with both `when` and `run`; anything else
(a non-array, a non-object entry, or an entry missing either key) is a configuration error,
not a gate that is silently skipped.

## Priority ordering

`/csw:batch` sorts by priority. With `tracker: linear`, Linear's own scale applies — `1` is
Urgent through `4` is Low, and `0` (no priority) sorts last. Any other tracker sorts
numerically descending.

## Example

A full config, from the project this workflow grew out of:

```json
{
  "ticketPrefix": "TRA",
  "tracker": "linear",
  "validate": "just validate",
  "worktreeDir": ".claude/worktrees",
  "gates": [
    { "when": "**/migrations/**", "run": "just backend migrate-checksums" }
  ],
  "batch": { "maxTickets": 3, "singleWriterLabels": ["migration"] }
}
```

See [examples/csw.json](../examples/csw.json) for the complete version, and this repo's own
[.claude/csw.json](../.claude/csw.json) for a second, simpler worked example.

## Errors

`csw-config` and the tools built on it fail loudly rather than guess:

| Exit | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | Success. A key explicitly set to `null` prints `null` at exit `0` — that is different from the key being absent. |
| `1` | `csw-sweep` only: the current directory is a bare repository (no working tree), so there is nothing to sweep. |
| `2` | Bad usage: an unknown subcommand, wrong argument count, or an unknown config key. |
| `3` | Not inside a git repository. |
| `4` | The config file is not valid JSON, or is valid JSON that is not a JSON object (an array, a string, a number). |

`csw-gates` reuses exit `4` for a malformed `gates` value: not an array, an entry that is
not an object, or an entry missing `when` or `run`.

`csw-services` uses exit `2` for a missing worktree path, a non-numeric `--grace`, and any
argument passed to `orphans` — which reports and never acts, so it takes none. Everything else
it can report is exit `0`: **finding nothing is success**, the same rule `csw-sweep` follows,
and so is a platform where the host-process arm cannot run. That case prints an explicit
`not supported` note and still tears down compose projects, because a silent empty result would
read as "nothing running" — the one answer it must never give by accident. A `docker` that is
installed but not answering is reported as *unknown, not absent*, for the same reason.

`worktreeDir` is what scopes `csw-services orphans`: a compose project whose
`com.docker.compose.project.working_dir` names a path under it that no longer exists is provably
a worktree CSW created and removed, so the sweep reports it. Nothing outside `worktreeDir` is
ever claimed as ours.

`csw-ticket` reuses exit `4` for a broken `ticketPrefix` or `branchPattern` — an invalid prefix,
or a `branchPattern` that has no `<ticket>`/`<slug>` placeholder or renders to something that
is not a legal git branch name. That is a config problem, the same class as the two rows above
it, not a bad invocation of `csw-ticket` itself (which is exit `2`).
