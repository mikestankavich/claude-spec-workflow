## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-04

The batch release. 1.0.0 could take one ticket to a pull request; 1.1.0 is the work needed
before a loop of them can run overnight without a human in the room — a spec pass in front of
the dispatch, a way to see the selection before it fires, a supervised flavour for the tickets
that deserve one, isolation between dispatches, and somewhere for a decision to live once the
ticket that produced it is closed.

### Added
- **`/csw:prep` — spec a ticket before it is dispatched, with no repo side effects.** A batch
  loop only compounds after a failure: a ticket blocks, the question lands on the ticket, and
  the next dispatch starts from a better brief. Prep moves that discovery in front of the
  dispatch, where it costs a comment rather than a night. It opens no worktree, no branch and
  no PR, and leaves the ticket in Todo; its output is a single `**CSW prep**` comment carrying
  a first-pass spec, the decisions it made with the reasoning behind each, and whatever it
  could not settle. Prep is interactive by design — you typed it and you are sitting there —
  and it triages on a test it can apply to itself: if an option can be marked
  "(Recommended)", that is the answer, so decide it and record why. Only two branches survive
  to be asked: no recommendation can be formed, or the cost of being wrong is paid outside
  this repo. Measured over four tickets, that turned 4–6 questions each into the one or two
  that genuinely needed a human. Several sessions prep in parallel safely, one ticket each;
  two sessions given the *same* ticket is the collision, because two markers race into one
  thread. (#73, #95)
- **`/csw:work <ticket> interactive`.** The word was undefined behaviour — `$ARGUMENTS`
  expanded it into the skill unexplained, and whether it beat the autonomous directive was
  unpredictable. It now brainstorms against the ticket before planning and waits for the
  answers. It changes planning only: the same validation, the same gates, the same hard stop
  at an open PR. An unrecognised modifier is now named back and asked about rather than
  silently discarded. (#72)
- **`/csw:batch --dry-run`.** Prints the selection and stops — no worktree, no branch, no PR.
  Pass a lower cap alongside it (`/csw:batch 2 --dry-run`) to see where a smaller batch would
  cut. Makes the loop observable before it dispatches. (#71)
- **`trackerCommand` config key** — an escape hatch from tracker MCP for `/csw:batch` only.
  There is no official Linear CLI and this plugin's dependency set stays git, `gh` and `jq`,
  but for a whole column the difference is real: one command returning exactly the array
  `csw-batch-filter` consumes, versus several MCP calls plus in-context reshaping, which is
  where an agent introduces errors. It replaces the fetch, not the tracker — `tracker` must
  still be set correctly, and the command must be read-only. Empty by default. (#74)
- **`adrDir` config key — ask whether the work outlives its ticket.** Nothing in CSW ever
  asked whether a run produced knowledge worth keeping; a rejected approach or a
  hard-won constraint landed in a PR description nobody reads twice, and unattended batching
  made it worse. Set it and `/csw:work` Step 8 asks once, before its hard stop, whether the
  run produced a durable decision — writing the ADR into that directory and pushing it onto
  the already-open PR as its own commit, gated on its own path, announced as proposed. Batch's
  report contract grows an `adr` field and the morning summary a section of its own, because
  an ADR that merges unnoticed is the one way writing them unattended goes wrong. Empty by
  default, so repos without ADRs see none of this. (#75)
- **`csw-gates --worktree <base-ref>`** — derives the Step 6 file list itself from
  NUL-delimited git output. `--files` keeps its stdin contract as an escape hatch and test
  seam. (#70)
- **`assert_guards` test helper** — scopes a needle to the region of a skill file that
  documents the behaviour, so reverting the behaviour deletes the region and the assertion
  goes red. (#69)
- **`bin/csw-services`, and `/csw:cleanup` stops a worktree's services before removing it.**
  Removing a worktree never stopped what was running in it: the directory went and the dev
  server, the file watcher and the database container survived, with nothing left to identify
  them by. So cleanup was not merely failing to tidy up, it was what *manufactured* orphans —
  and the cost is not a wasted process but a test run going green against a database belonging
  to a branch that shipped ten hours ago, with every precondition check passing. A healthy
  orphan gets *adopted* rather than ignored, by every session that finds it on the expected
  port, which is what makes one permanent. `csw-services` takes one worktree path and reads
  origin out of bookkeeping the machine already keeps — `/proc/<pid>/cwd` for host processes,
  `com.docker.compose.project.working_dir` for compose projects — so nothing is written and
  nothing can go stale. It signals process groups, not pids, because the tree's leaf is what
  holds the port. Supervised `systemctl --user` units, unlabelled containers and anything
  outside the worktree are never touched, and there is no machine-wide acting mode. Teardown
  is mandatory and unprompted, on the same rule as branch cleanup, and it names everything
  before it signals it. `csw-sweep` reports the two populations it must not act on: what is
  running from a stale worktree, and compose projects whose worktree is already gone. (#119)

### Changed
- **`/csw:batch` dispatches each ticket to a fresh subagent.** Step 4 previously ran every
  `/csw:work` dispatch in the controlling session, so ticket two inherited ticket one's plan,
  its diff and its dead ends — the worktrees were isolated, the mind driving them was not,
  which contradicts the clear-before-every-dispatch discipline the whole workflow rests on.
  Each ticket now goes to a fresh subagent, dispatched synchronously in order, briefed with
  the ticket reference and nothing else. The controller keeps only loop state and the row each
  dispatch returns, so the morning summary is assembled from results rather than reconstructed
  from a transcript, and a failed ticket is one row in that summary instead of the end of the
  night. (#78)
- **`csw-batch-filter`'s output grows a third key, `belowCap`.** Cap overflow is now reported
  separately from exclusions: a ticket the cap pushed out is a ticket that will run tomorrow,
  and reporting it in the same bucket as one excluded for a reason misrepresents the night.
  This is a change to a contract released in 1.0.0 — it is an internal tool with a single
  in-repo consumer, so practical impact is nil, but it is a shape change and belongs here
  rather than in a footnote. (#71)
- **`/csw:work` reads the `**CSW prep**` comment as part of the brief.** A decision prep
  recorded is a decision to build on. A prep question answered in the thread is a decision
  too. A prep question still unanswered is a strong signal the ticket is not ready to run
  unattended, and routes to Step 9's draft path rather than to a guess — except on an
  `interactive` run, where the human who can answer is present. (#73)

### Fixed
- **Step 6 dropped gates for three separate classes of path, each producing a gate that
  silently did not run.** The union of the committed diff and the working tree was hand-rolled
  in shell as `git status --porcelain | cut -c4- | sed 's/.* -> //'`. Git C-style-quotes any
  path containing a space or a non-ASCII byte, so the quotes reached the matcher and matched
  no glob. The greedy `sed` split a rename on the *last* ` -> ` in the line, which is inside
  the destination when the destination itself contains that substring. And without `-uall`, a
  brand-new untracked directory collapsed to the directory alone, so a new
  `backend/migrations/0002.sql` arrived as `backend/` and `**/migrations/**` never fired — no
  unusual filename required, and precisely the case Step 6's working-tree half exists to
  cover. The derivation moved into `csw-gates --worktree`, where no path is ever split on its
  own content: deletions contribute nothing, renames and copies contribute their destination
  only, and a path containing a literal newline is a hard exit 2 rather than a skipped gate.
  (#70)
- **24 assertions in `tests/test-skills.sh` guarded nothing.** Their needles also occurred
  outside the behaviour they were meant to protect — most often in the `## Red flags` table,
  where every skill restates its load-bearing rules by design — so the assertion passed with
  the behaviour reverted. Measured on a scratch copy with each guard's region deleted: all 25
  guards now fail on that revert, and for 18 of them the old whole-file needle survived it.
  Those were live false positives, not defensive changes. (#69)

## [1.0.3] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed
- **`csw-sweep`'s upstream-gone detection had never fired.** It finds branches deleted on the
  forge through `%(upstream:track)` reporting `[gone]`, which only happens once
  `refs/remotes/origin/<name>` is missing *locally*. `gh pr merge --delete-branch` deletes the
  branch on the forge; only a prune removes the local mirror, and nothing in the workflow pruned
  — `/csw:cleanup`'s `git pull` does not, absent `fetch.prune`. Every leftover the sweep ever
  found came from the merged-into-base arm instead, which is exactly the arm that cannot see a
  branch that shipped without becoming an ancestor of the base. `/csw:cleanup` Step 2 now runs
  `git pull --prune` before the sweep, with the reason recorded so the flag is not tidied away
  later. The sweep cannot fix this itself: never fetching is a deliberate invariant, and pruning
  mutates refs.
- `/csw:cleanup`'s sibling-PR search ran unscoped across all of GitHub. With `tracker: github`
  the ticket is a bare number, so searching for `81` returned thirty strangers' PRs and not one
  sibling — thirty false positives being precisely the output an agent skims past. The query is
  now scoped with `--owner`, with a title search and a `--match title,body` form for numeric
  tickets, and the skill says plainly that a long result list means the query was too broad
  rather than that there are many siblings.

### Changed
- `csw-sweep`'s report carries a second `note:` line when upstream-gone detection may be stale,
  for standalone invocations that have no skill wrapped around them to prune first. It fires
  only when it could change the answer — when some branch that is not the base and is not
  already reported still resolves an upstream, which is precisely the set a prune could add to
  the report. Unconditional would be noise that teaches the reader to skip `note:` lines,
  costing the base-behind note its audience too.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed
- `/csw:cleanup` now **verifies** `ExitWorktree`'s "will discard N commits" warning instead of
  trusting it. Before passing `discard_changes: true` it captures the branch head and runs
  `git merge-base --is-ancestor "$head_sha" origin/<base>`: exit 0 proves the commits are already
  on the remote and nothing is lost, non-zero means the warning is real — stop and report, do not
  discard. The skill previously said nothing about this warning, leaving an agent to either stall
  on something it could not evaluate or wave it through reflexively, and the second habit
  eventually deletes work that really was unmerged.

### Changed
- **The discard warning is documented as unavoidable.** `ExitWorktree` compares the branch against
  the worktree's *creation point*, so the warning fires on every cleanup and **cannot be suppressed
  by anything cleanup does**. This was measured, not assumed: the local base branch was moved
  *ahead* of the branch head before exiting and the warning fired anyway. Because it always fires
  it carries no information on its own, which is precisely why the `merge-base` check is the only
  defence. The skill records the null result so the experiment is not run a third time.
- The branch name shown in the warning is the pre-rename `worktree-<slug>`, which makes
  `/csw:work` Step 4's rename look causal. It is not — the commit *count* is correct, and the
  stale name is display only. `/csw:cleanup` now says so, and says not to "fix" this by
  abandoning the rename that ties a branch to its ticket.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed
- `csw-sweep` missed branches merged into the base branch's **upstream** when the local base
  was behind it — the normal state on a machine where PRs are merged on the forge rather than
  locally, and precisely the staleness the sweep exists to catch. The merged set is now the
  union of `<base>` and `<base>@{upstream}`. No fetch: it reads only the remote-tracking ref
  already on disk.
- `csw-sweep` hid a merged branch when it was the one checked out, which silenced it about the
  single branch a human is most likely to care about. It is now reported like any other,
  annotated with the base branch to land on first — `git branch -d` refuses the checked-out
  branch.

### Changed
- `csw-sweep`'s report leads with a note when the local base is behind its upstream, so a
  quiet sweep is distinguishable from a stale one.
- **`csw-sweep branches` output contract:** a listed branch is no longer guaranteed deletable
  with `git branch -d` from where the caller stands. Git refuses loudly and harmlessly, which
  beats the previous silent omission.
- `csw-sweep worktrees` no longer lists the main working tree. `git worktree remove` refuses
  it outright, so offering it as a removable leftover was an action that could not succeed.
  Its branch still appears in `csw-sweep branches`.
- `/csw:cleanup` handles a swept branch that is the current branch — land on the base, pull,
  then delete — and states its end condition explicitly: it finishes on the base branch,
  current with its remote.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-02

CSW is now Claude **Ship** Workflow. Complete rewrite: superpowers owns how the work gets
done, CSW owns how it gets shipped and closed out.

### Added
- `/csw:work <ticket>` — dispatch a ticket into a worktree, drive it autonomously to an open
  pull request, then hard-stop for review.
- `/csw:merge` — CI-gated merge on natural-language approval, chaining into cleanup.
- `/csw:cleanup` — worktree and branch removal plus an unprompted sweep for other stale
  branches and worktrees. Always asks before closing a ticket.
- `/csw:batch` — nightly loop with blocked, same-surface-cluster, and single-writer filters
  and a morning summary.
- `.claude/csw.json` config layer, so a different project is a config file rather than a fork.
- `bin/csw-config`, `bin/csw-ticket`, `bin/csw-gates`, `bin/csw-sweep`, `bin/csw-batch-filter`.
- Bash test suite and CI.

### Removed
- **BREAKING:** `/csw:spec`, `/csw:plan`, `/csw:build`, `/csw:check`, `/csw:ship`, the `csw`
  binary, `spec/` trees, presets, and templates. Old and new must not coexist. Use
  [superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) for that half of the workflow.

### Changed
- Ships as a Claude Code plugin marketplace instead of a shell installer.
- Repository rename to `claude-ship-workflow` is planned to follow this release, once this
  branch merges.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-23

> **Skill Framework Migration**: Native Claude Code integration with colon-namespaced commands

### Breaking Changes

- Commands renamed to colon namespace: `/spec` → `/csw:spec`, `/plan` → `/csw:plan`, etc.
- `/cleanup` deprecated — cleanup now runs automatically at start of `/csw:spec`
- `cleanup/merged` branch pattern removed
- Requires `csw migrate && csw install` for existing users

### Added

- SKILL.md for Claude Code autonomous discovery (`skills/csw/SKILL.md`)
- `csw migrate` subcommand for removing old command files
- Dirty-tree guard at start of `/csw:spec`
- Automatic cleanup of completed specs at start of each new spec cycle
- `cleanup_completed_specs()` function in `scripts/lib/cleanup.sh`
- `csw --version` now reads from VERSION file

### Changed

- `csw install` now installs skill + namespaced commands, detects old files
- `csw init` now installs `.claude/skills/` and `.claude/commands/` at project scope
- `csw uninstall` removes both skill and namespaced commands + old files
- All command markdowns updated with `csw:` prefix references
- `spec/active/` path references updated to `spec/` throughout

### Removed

- Standalone `/cleanup` command (prints deprecation notice)
- `cleanup/merged` branch detection in `/csw:plan`
- Old un-namespaced command file installation
- SHIPPED.md references (already retired in previous cycle)

### Fixed

- `csw --version` was hardcoded to 0.2.2, now reads VERSION file
- Stale `spec/active/` path references in command docs (#48)

## [0.3.2] - 2025-10-23

> **Bug Fix**: Cleanup script branch detection

### Fixed

- **`/cleanup` branch detection exit code handling**
  - Fixed critical bug where ls-remote exit codes were captured incorrectly
  - Root cause: `local ls_exit=$?` inside else block captured exit code of if evaluation (0), not ls-remote command (2)
  - Impact: Branches with deleted remotes (squash/rebase merges) weren't being cleaned up
  - Solution: Capture exit code before conditional logic, use elif chain for clarity
  - Now correctly deletes branches merged via GitHub squash/rebase strategies
  - Changed in: `scripts/lib/cleanup.sh:127-145`

## [0.3.1] - 2025-10-23

> **Critical Bug Fix**: Prevents data loss from cleanup script

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL: `/cleanup` spec deletion logic** (Issue #35)
  - Fixed false positive deletions where specs mentioned in SHIPPED.md descriptions were incorrectly deleted
  - Root cause: `grep -q "$feature_name"` matched feature names anywhere in SHIPPED.md, not just section headers
  - Example: Spec `3.3.2/` was deleted because a different feature's entry contained "Foundation for: Phase 3.3.2"
  - **Solution**: Use `log.md` filesystem existence as definitive proof of completion instead of text parsing
  - `log.md` on main proves: `/build` ran → committed → PR merged → feature complete
  - Eliminates all text-matching edge cases and simplifies cleanup logic
  - Backward compatible: all shipped specs have log.md; unshipped specs are preserved
  - **Impact**: Prevents data loss for work-in-progress specs referenced in shipped feature descriptions
  - Changed in: `scripts/cleanup.sh:59-83`

- **`/cleanup` command**: Fixed branch detection to handle squash-merged and rebase-merged PRs (Issues #20, #30)
  - Added `git fetch --prune origin` to sync remote state before detection (fixes timing issues)
  - Implemented dual detection: traditional `--merged` check + remote tracking verification
  - Now reliably detects branches merged via any GitHub strategy (merge commit, squash, rebase)
  - Eliminates manual cleanup for orphaned local branches after merging PRs

- Fix output formatting across all workflow commands (/plan, /check, /build, /ship)
  - Added explicit OUTPUT FORMATTING RULES sections to prevent list item concatenation
  - Each command now includes visual examples (✅ correct vs ❌ wrong) for clear guidance
  - Resolves issue where multiple choice options, checkmarks, and bullet points were rendered as walls of text

- Fix `csw install` failing to create CLI symlink due to arithmetic operator bug with `set -e`
- Fix similar counter increment bugs in `csw uninstall`, validation suite, and cleanup workflow
- All bash scripts now use `var=$((var + 1))` instead of `((var++))` for `set -e` compatibility

### Migration Notes

**If you have been using v0.3.0**:
- No action required - the fix is backward compatible
- All existing shipped specs already have `log.md` on main branch
- Update immediately to prevent potential data loss from cleanup operations

**Recommended**: Pull and reinstall:
```bash
cd claude-spec-workflow
git pull
./csw install
```

## [0.3.0] - 2025-10-15

> **Bootstrap & Workflow Consolidation**: Unified CLI + workflow automation + infrastructure refactoring

  - Maximum discoverability: visible immediately after clone
  - Follows industry patterns (gradlew, mvnw, configure)
- **BREAKING**: Removed `bin/` directory (empty after csw move)
- **BREAKING**: Deleted `install.sh`, `init-project.sh`, `uninstall.sh` (replaced by csw subcommands)
- **BREAKING**: EOL PowerShell installation scripts (PR #5)
  - Removed install.ps1, init-project.ps1, uninstall.ps1
  - Windows users must use Git Bash or WSL2
  - Reduces installer codebase by 50%

#### Workflow Improvements
- **`/ship` workflow** - Single-commit SHIPPED.md update (PR #14)
  - Reordered steps: push → PR → SHIPPED.md (eliminates "PR: pending" states)
  - Updated template: short commit hash, full PR URL on separate line
  - Commit format: `docs: ship {feature} (#{pr-number})`
  - Method 4 (manual fallback) now fails fast
- **Commands simplified** - From ~100 lines to ~15 lines each (PR #9)
  - Replaced 28 embedded bash blocks with 5 clean csw calls

  - CONTRIBUTING.md: Development setup
  - TESTING.md: All test procedures
  - commands/*.md: All command references
  - templates/: stack-template.md, bootstrap-spec.md

### Fixed

- **CSW symlink resolution** (PR #13)
  - Fixed critical bug where commands failed when invoked via `~/.local/bin/csw` symlink
  - Implemented industry-standard symlink resolution (Node.js/Homebrew pattern)
  - Handles absolute/relative symlinks, multi-level chains
  - POSIX compliant (Linux, macOS, WSL, Git Bash)

### Internal

- **Script library refactoring** (PR #6, #7, #9)
  - Extracted ~400 lines from commands into standalone scripts
  - Created 6 executable scripts: spec.sh, plan.sh, build.sh, check.sh, ship.sh, cleanup.sh
  - Zero duplication: all use Phase 1 library functions
  - All scripts pass shellcheck with zero errors/warnings
- **Terminology shift**: "archive" → "cleanup" throughout codebase (PR #11)

### Migration Guide

If upgrading from v0.2.x:

1. **Reinstall globally**:
   ```bash
   cd claude-spec-workflow
   git pull
   ./csw install  # New command location and syntax
   ```

2. **Update existing projects** (optional):
   - Projects with `spec/` already initialized will continue to work
   - To update project-local wrapper: `cd your-project && csw init .` (confirm overwrite)
   - To skip bootstrap spec: use `--no-bootstrap-spec` flag

3. **Update scripts/automation**:
   - Replace `./install.sh` → `./csw install`
   - Replace `init-project.sh /path/to/project` → `csw init /path/to/project`
   - Replace `./uninstall.sh` → `csw uninstall`

4. **Windows users**: Use Git Bash or WSL2 (PowerShell no longer supported)

**No data loss**: All existing `spec/` directories and SHIPPED.md files preserved.

**See SHIPPED.md** for detailed success metrics (10 features, 100% metrics achieved on most)

_No other unreleased changes. See README.md Roadmap section for planned features._

- Mandatory split recommendation for features scoring 6-10/10
- Optional phase breakdown generation for complex features
- Mandatory clarifying questions gate before plan generation
- Quality/confidence scoring in implementation plans with one-pass success probability
- ULTRATHINK strategic thinking checkpoints in all 5 commands
- Mandatory validation gates: lint, types, tests, build (BLOCKING requirements)
- Full test suite gate before any commit in `/build` (cannot skip, 100% pass required)
- Code cleanup gate before final validation (removes console.log, debugger, commented code)
- Auto-detection and defaults for Node/TypeScript, Rust, Go, Python stacks
- Stack-aware validation commands and patterns
- Workspace-aware validation for monorepo projects
- Success Metrics section in spec template with tracking in SHIPPED.md
- Conventional Commits format with semantic versioning support
- Role-based personas for each command (Product Engineer, Architect, Engineer, Test Engineer, Tech Lead)
- Automatic archival of shipped features during `/plan` with y/n prompts
- SHIPPED.md tracking with date, commit, and success metrics
- Comprehensive README with installation and usage instructions
- Installation guides for macOS, Linux, and Windows
- Quick start guide with step-by-step workflow
- Stack configuration examples for single-stack and monorepo projects
