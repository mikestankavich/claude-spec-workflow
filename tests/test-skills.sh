# --- assert_contains vs assert_guards, throughout this file ---
#
# Every assertion here guards a behaviour some skill documents, and its job is to
# go red when that behaviour is removed. A whole-file `assert_contains` only does
# that while its needle occurs *nowhere else in the file*: the moment it also
# appears somewhere the behaviour does not live, a revert leaves the needle
# behind and the assertion stays green while guarding nothing. That is #69.
#
# So the rule in this file is mechanical rather than stylistic: **if the needle
# is not unique to the behaviour's own region, the assertion uses
# `assert_guards`** and names the region it protects. A needle that occurs once
# already has the property — it vanishes with the region — and stays on
# `assert_contains`.
#
# A deliberate consequence: a region is *not* required to be the only place the
# needle appears in the file. Every skill restates its load-bearing rules in
# `## Red flags`, and this file separately asserts those restatements. Requiring
# the needle to be absent outside its region would fail on that convention
# working as intended, and would only be the uniqueness rule under another name.
# Present-inside-the-region is what makes a revert bite; that is the whole
# contract.
#
# **A needle must not straddle a line wrap.** Both `assert_contains` and
# `assert_guards` match against the file's text as written, so a phrase the skill
# happens to break across two lines is not found — the assertion goes red against
# prose that says exactly the right thing. The failure looks like a missing rule
# and is actually a wrap, which is an expensive minute every time. Keep needles
# short enough to survive reflowing, and where a long phrase is the thing worth
# guarding, put it on its own line in the skill.
