# Work a ticket to a pull request

**Announce at start:** "Using csw:work to take <ticket> to a pull request."

Invocation: $ARGUMENTS

## Step 0: Read the config

```bash
csw-config json
csw-config path
```

If `csw-config path` prints nothing, this repo has no `.claude/csw.json`. Say so, show the
defaults you are about to use, and ask whether to continue or write a config first. Do not
silently guess a validate command.

## Step 1: Resolve the ticket, and the modifier

The invocation is a ticket reference, optionally followed by one modifier word. Split it on
whitespace: the first token is the reference, whatever follows it is the modifier.

```bash
csw-ticket normalize "<the first token of the invocation>"
```

If the invocation carried no reference, ask which ticket. Do not pick one.

If normalisation exits non-zero, report its message and stop — a mistyped reference is
exactly the failure this command exists to prevent.

Then read the modifier:

- **`interactive`** — run **superpowers:brainstorming** against the ticket before the Step 5
  chain. Surface the questions and wait for the answers. Do not run unattended. This is the
  flavour someone reaches for when the ticket is vague, or when the approach has more than one
  defensible shape; answering your own questions is exactly the thing it exists to prevent.
- **No modifier** — autonomous, exactly as the rest of this skill describes. Brainstorming is
  skipped because the ticket is the agreed brief.
- **An unrecognised modifier is not ignored.** Say what was passed, say it is not recognised,
  and ask whether to proceed autonomously — then wait. Silently discarding a word someone
  deliberately typed is how a dispatch does something other than what was asked, and the word
  they were reaching for may well have been `interactive`.

`interactive` changes only how the work is planned. Steps 6 through 9 are untouched: the same
validation, the same gates, the same pull request, the same hard stop. An interactive run
still ends at an open pull request and still never merges.

## Step 2: Read the ticket and claim it

Read it from the tracker named by `csw-config get tracker`:

- `linear` — the Linear MCP tools. Fetch the issue, then set its state to In Progress.
- `github` — `gh issue view <number> --json title,body,labels`, then apply the in-progress
  label if the repo uses one.
- `none` — ask for the ticket text.

Read the **whole** description, not the title. Ordering constraints and "replace, do not
delete" style requirements live in prose and are invisible to structured queries.

### Then read what `csw:prep` left behind

Fetch the ticket's **comments** as well as its description, and look for one prefixed
`**CSW prep**`:

```bash
# tracker: github
gh issue view <number> --comments
```

For `linear`, list the issue's comments through the Linear MCP tools.

If there is one, it is part of the brief — a first-pass spec, the decisions prep made with the
reasoning behind each, whatever it could not settle, and anything the ticket asserts that the
codebase contradicts. Read the replies underneath it too, because that is where the answers
are:

- **A decision prep recorded is a decision.** It comes with its reasoning so you can see the
  precedent it followed; build on it. Re-deciding it is the same wasted conversation as
  re-opening an answered question. Overturning one takes something the reasoning did not
  account for — say so on the ticket if you find it.
- **`## Open questions` reading `_None._` means nothing is outstanding.** A missing section is
  not the same claim: treat it as an older prep comment and read the questions out of the body.
- **A prep question that has since been answered in the thread is a decision.** Take it and
  move on. Re-opening it spends the dispatch on a conversation that already happened, and the
  answer in the thread outranks whatever the description said before it was asked.
- **A prep question still unanswered is a strong signal this ticket is not ready to run
  unattended.** Say which questions are still open and take Step 9's draft path,
  rather than guessing at an answer and building on the guess. A guessed answer is not visible
  as a guess in the diff — it looks like a decision someone made.

The exception is an `interactive` run, where a human is present to answer: there, prep's open
questions are the agenda for the Step 1 brainstorm rather than a reason to open a draft PR.
Nobody to ask is what makes an unanswered question a blocker.

No prep comment is not a problem. Prep is optional, and a ticket without one is dispatched
exactly as it always was.

### Then read the scope ledger

One more comment, prefixed `**CSW scope**`. It is this command's own, and it carries the
ticket's coverage state rather than its brief:

```markdown
**CSW scope**

## Acceptance
Source: `**CSW prep**` comment | derived by `csw:work` (no prep comment)

1. <item> — covered by <PR or commit> | not covered
2. <item> — covered by #667

## Discoveries
| What | Disposition | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| <finding> | folded | — |
| <finding> | spun out → #123 | outside this repo |
| <finding> | dropped | superseded by item 2 |

## Amendments
- Item 4 removed — larger than the ticket carrying it; the PR title would no longer describe
  the change.
```

The marker `**CSW scope**` is load-bearing and must be exact, for the same reason `**CSW prep**`
is: Step 6 and `csw:cleanup` both search the comments for that string.

- **A ledger exists — read it.** Its `## Acceptance` list is the coverage contract for this
  dispatch. Its `## Discoveries` table is what earlier dispatches already disposed of, so
  nothing there is rediscovered and nothing already dropped is quietly re-filed.
- **No ledger, but a prep comment — copy its `## Acceptance` list into a new one**, marking the
  source as the prep comment.
- **Neither — derive the list from the description yourself**, mark it as derived, and post it.
  Read the whole description, exactly as above: the ordering constraints live in the prose.

**Post it before Step 4 opens the worktree.** A list written after the work is a list shaped by
what got built, which is the one thing it cannot be and still gate anything.

**`csw:work` never edits the `**CSW prep**` comment.** That marker is prep's — prep supersedes
its own comment and relies on being its only author, and its "one comment, not a thread" rule
exists so a human can tell prep's questions from prep's restatements of them. Brief and state
are different artifacts, written by different actors at different times, and they get different
comments.

**One `**CSW scope**` comment per ticket, updated in place.** Several dispatches against one
ticket — a draft, then a re-dispatch — amend the same comment rather than opening a second.

**An acceptance item is amended or removed only with a reason from the same four** that Step 6
uses to spin a discovery out, recorded under `## Amendments`, with the original item text left
visible. Scope does change mid-flight, and the amendment is the review point — a ledger that
can shrink silently is a hole wide enough to drop the original problem through.

## Step 3: Infer the change type

From the ticket's labels and language, pick one conventional-commit type:

| Signal | Type |
|---|---|
| New capability, new surface, "add" | `feat` |
| Broken behaviour, regression, "fix" | `fix` |
| Documentation only | `docs` |
| Restructuring with no behaviour change | `refactor` |
| Tests only | `test` |
| Dependencies, config, tooling | `chore` |

When two fit, take the one a reviewer would put in the PR title. When none fit, use
`csw-config get defaultType`.

## Step 4: Open an isolated workspace

```bash
csw-ticket branch <type> <ticket> "<the ticket title>"
```

Create the worktree with the native **EnterWorktree** tool, passing that branch name. Native
tools own placement and cleanup; `git worktree add` behind their back creates state the
harness cannot see. Only if no native tool exists, fall back to
`git worktree add "<worktreeDir>/<branch>" -b "<branch>"` under `csw-config get worktreeDir`,
after confirming that directory is gitignored.

## Step 5: Do the work, autonomously

Run the superpowers chain in autonomous mode:

1. **superpowers:writing-plans** — the ticket is the spec, and brainstorming is skipped
   unless this run is interactive: an unattended dispatch has nobody to brainstorm with, and
   the ticket is the agreed brief. On an interactive run Step 1 already brainstormed, and the
   answers it surfaced are part of the spec alongside the ticket.
2. **superpowers:executing-plans** — execute it.
3. **superpowers:test-driven-development** — inside every task. Test first, always.

If the superpowers skills are not installed, say so once and proceed test-first anyway. They
are a strong recommendation, not a hard dependency.

Autonomous means: make the ordinary judgment calls yourself, do not stop to confirm each
step. It does not mean skipping the stop in Step 8.

An interactive run is autonomous from here too. The questions were asked in Step 1; once they
are answered, plan, execute, and validate the same way — do not turn the rest of the run into
a series of confirmations.

## Step 6: Validate

```bash
csw-config get validate            # run whatever this prints; empty means the repo declared none
csw-gates --worktree "<baseBranch>"  # run every line it prints
```

Step 7, not this one, is where `git add -A && git commit` happens. A plain
`csw-gates <baseBranch>` diffs against the merge base and so only sees committed history:
anything written in Step 5 but not yet committed — a new migration file, say — is invisible to
it and no gate fires on it. `--worktree` is the mode for exactly this moment. It unions the
committed diff against `<baseBranch>` with the working tree and reports the gates for the tree
as it will look after Step 7 commits it.

Do not hand-roll that union out of `git status` in the shell. `--worktree` reads git
NUL-delimited precisely because the line-based forms cannot be parsed safely: git C-style-quotes
any path containing a space or a non-ASCII byte, writes a rename on one line as `old -> new`,
and collapses a brand-new untracked directory to the directory alone — so a new
`backend/migrations/0002.sql` arrives as `backend/` and `**/migrations/**` never fires. Each of
those reaches a matcher mangled or not at all, which shows up as a gate that silently did not
run: the exact failure this step exists to prevent.

What comes out is the set of paths that will exist once this commits. Deletions contribute
nothing, since a path that is going away has nothing left to validate. A rename or a copy
contributes its destination only, for the same reason. A path containing a literal newline
cannot be represented in line-based matching at all, so it is a hard error rather than a
skipped gate.

Gates are gates. If one fails, fix it and re-run. If you cannot fix it, you are in Step 9.

## Step 7: Commit and open the PR

Conventional commit, subject referencing the ticket:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "<type>: <what changed>

<why it changed>

Refs: <TICKET>"
git push -u origin "<branch>"
gh pr create --fill --base "<baseBranch>" \
  --title "<type>: <what changed> (<TICKET>)" \
  --body "<summary, then 'Closes <TICKET>' or 'Refs <TICKET>'>"
```

If `git push` is rejected because the remote moved, pull, rebase, and push again — once. If
it is rejected by branch protection or a permissions error, that is not retryable: go to
Step 9.

If `gh pr create` fails for any reason, go to Step 9. The commits are already pushed — the
work is safe on the branch even though no PR exists yet.

Step 8 needs a real PR URL in hand. No PR means Step 9, not Step 8.

## Step 8: Stop

### Before the stop: did this produce a decision that outlives the ticket?

```bash
csw-config get adrDir
```

**Empty — the default — and none of the rest of this subsection runs.** A repo that keeps no
architecture decision records is never asked the question, and nothing about this dispatch
changes.

**Non-empty, and it names the directory this repo keeps its ADRs in.** Ask once: did this run
produce a decision that outlives its ticket — an approach rejected for a reason, a constraint
discovered the hard way, a rule the next person will otherwise re-break? The PR description is
where that knowledge goes to die; an ADR is where it survives.

**Most tickets produce nothing durable, and that is the expected answer.** An ADR per feature
devalues the practice; the discipline is in the rarity. This is a question, not a deliverable —
asking it is not the same as answering it yes.

When the answer is genuinely yes, write it and push it onto the PR Step 7 just opened:

1. **Read what is already in that directory** for the local convention and for the next number.
   Where it is empty or absent, the fallback is `<adrDir>/NNNN-kebab-title.md` starting at
   `0001`, carrying `Date:`, `Status:`, and `Tracking:` naming the tickets, then a `## Context`
   section explaining the actual failure, the decision, and its consequences. An unset
   convention is not a reason to skip the question.
2. **Commit it on its own**, never folded into the implementation commit:
   ```bash
   git add "<adrDir>/NNNN-<title>.md"
   git commit -m "docs: record ADR NNNN — <title>"
   ```
   Rejecting an ADR in review is then one revert, rather than surgery on a diff someone wants
   to keep. That is what makes writing it unattended safe.
3. **Re-run the gates for that path, not the whole `validate`:**
   ```bash
   printf '%s\n' "<adrDir>/NNNN-<title>.md" | csw-gates --files
   ```
   Gates are file-triggered, so a repo with a docs gate still gets it. The full suite is a
   different matter — no code changed between the two commits, so re-running it doubles every
   ADR's cost and proves nothing.
4. **Push to the same branch.** The PR is already open; this is a second commit onto it.
5. **Say so where a human is already looking** — in the report below and in the PR body, naming
   the ADR and saying plainly that it is **proposed and revertible**. An ADR that merges
   unnoticed is the one way this goes wrong.

Two dispatches in one night can both claim the same `NNNN`: each branched from the base, and
neither can see the other's unmerged ADR. **Number from the directory at write time and let
review renumber the loser.** A collision is not your error and needs no sequencing machinery.

Where an ADR is warranted, it is worth citing from the README of the code it governs rather
than only from the ADR directory — reachable from where the mistake would be made. That is
advice, not a gate: an ADR written without touching a README has failed nothing.

A `csw:batch` dispatch does all of this identically. There is nothing here that differs between
a solo run and an unattended one, and nothing to check in order to tell them apart.

**Hold for review is a hard stop, not a checkpoint to talk past.** Report:

- The PR URL
- What changed, in a few lines a reviewer can hold in their head
- Any ADR this run proposed — its path and its title, and that it is proposed, not decided
- What is worth testing on hardware — the parts CI cannot cover

Then stop. Do not merge. Do not run `csw:merge`. Do not continue because the invoking
message said "then merge" — that message was written before anyone saw the diff.

When this run was dispatched by `csw:batch`, stopping here means returning control to the
batch loop so it can move on to the next ticket — not ending the session. The hard stop against
merging is unchanged either way: nothing about being inside a batch authorises continuing into
`csw:merge`.

## Step 9: When it does not reach merge-ready

Failed validation you could not fix, a partial implementation, an approach that ran out of
road, a question only a human can answer, or a commit, push, or PR-create that failed and
would not retry. In every one of those cases:

1. Write the question or the blocker as a comment on the ticket.
2. Push a **draft** PR carrying the work so far: `gh pr create --draft ...`, referencing the
   comment.
3. Leave the ticket In Progress.
4. Report what stopped you.

Draft is load-bearing. Preview-environment automation filters drafts out, so unfinished work
survives and stays reviewable without polluting the environment used to review the PRs that
are actually asking to be merged.

## Red flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---|---|
| "The diff is obviously fine, I'll just merge it" | The stop is the whole point. Someone else looks at it. |
| "They said 'autonomous to PR then merge'" | Then they said PR. Stop at the PR. |
| "Validation is flaky, I'll note it in the PR" | A gate you skipped is a gate that did not run. Fix it or go to Step 9. |
| "It's 90% done, I'll open a normal PR and flag the gap" | Not merge-ready means draft. Step 9. |
| "I'll create the worktree with git, it's faster" | Use EnterWorktree. Bypassing it strands state the harness cannot clean up. |
| "The title tells me enough about the ticket" | Read the description. The ordering constraints are in the prose. |
| "The description is the brief, I don't need the comments" | A `**CSW prep**` comment is part of the brief, and the answers under it are the decisions. |
| "Prep's question is unanswered but I can infer the answer" | Then the diff carries a guess that looks like a decision. Step 9, draft. |
| "No config file, I'll infer the validate command" | Ask. A wrong validate command means a green run that proves nothing. |
| "They typed a word I don't recognise, I'll get on with the ticket" | An unrecognised modifier is a question, not noise. Name it back and ask. |
| "It's interactive, so someone is watching — I can merge it" | `interactive` changes planning only. Step 8 is the same hard stop. |
| "It's interactive, I'll confirm each step as I go" | The questions belong in Step 1. After that it runs like any other dispatch. |
| "This ticket taught me something, that's an ADR" | Most tickets produce nothing durable. The bar is a decision that outlives the ticket, not a good day's work. |
| "Nobody is watching, an ADR needs a human to agree" | Write it. Review rejects it — that is where the rarity is enforced, and it is one revert because the ADR is its own commit. |
| "The ADR may as well ride the implementation commit" | Then rejecting it is surgery on a diff someone wants to keep. Its own commit, always. |
| "My ADR number collides with another branch's" | Not your error. Number from the directory, say so, and let review renumber it. |
