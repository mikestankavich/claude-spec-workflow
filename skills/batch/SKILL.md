# Dispatch a batch of tickets

**Announce at start:** "Using csw:batch to dispatch tonight's tickets."

Tonight's invocation carried: $ARGUMENTS

Two modifiers, and they compose:

- **A bare integer** lowers tonight's cap. Never raises it — see Step 2.
- **`--dry-run`**, also written `dry-run` or `dry run`, runs selection and stops — see
  Step 3.

So `/csw:batch 2 --dry-run` shows tonight's plan cut at 2 without dispatching anything.
Anything else in $ARGUMENTS is not a modifier: say what you ignored and why, rather than
guessing at what it meant.

## Before the first run: the prerequisite

This loop's first filter is "drop blocked tickets," and it only works if the tracker knows
what blocks what. If `blockedBy` is empty on most tickets while `relatedTo` carries three or
four links each, the dependency information exists but is in the wrong field and in prose.

**Backfill blocking relations on the Todo column before relying on this.** Check a sample
first, and if `blockedBy` is empty across the board, say so and stop rather than dispatching
a batch whose ordering constraints are invisible.

**Prepped tickets dispatch better.** `/csw:prep <ticket>` leaves a spec and its open questions
on the ticket, and `csw:work` Step 2 reads them, so a question that would have cost a whole
dispatch to discover is already answered when the loop reaches it. It is not required, and this
loop **does not skip unprepped** tickets — an optional command that silently became a gate
would be a new manual step in front of every ticket in the column.

## Step 1: Pull the candidates

Either way, this step ends with `candidates_json` holding a JSON array in the shape Step 2
pipes into `csw-batch-filter`:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "ENG-1075",
    "state": "Todo",
    "priority": 2,
    "labels": ["migration"],
    "blockedBy": [],
    "relatedTo": ["ENG-1080", "ENG-1081"]
  }
]
```

Which way depends on one key:

```bash
csw-config get trackerCommand
```

**Empty — read the tracker.** Read every Todo ticket from the tracker named by
`csw-config get tracker` and shape it into the array above yourself. This is the default, and
it is what `tracker: linear` does through MCP.

**Non-empty — run it, and its stdout _is the filter's input_.** Do not reshape it, do not
re-read the tracker, do not merge anything into it. Skipping the in-context reshaping across a
whole column of tickets is the entire reason the key exists — reshaping the output anyway keeps
the failure mode it was added to remove:

```bash
candidates_json=$(bash -c "$(csw-config get trackerCommand)")
```

- **`bash -c "<string>"` from the repo root, no arguments and no injected environment** — the
  same way `validate` and `gates[].run` are already run.
- **Capture stdout and check the exit status before piping.** `bash -c "$cmd" |
  csw-batch-filter` would report the *filter's* status, not the command's, so a failing command
  that printed a partial array reads as a selection rather than a failure. A non-zero exit is a
  **failed selection**: quote its stderr verbatim, say plainly that selection failed and no
  tickets were dispatched, and stop — exactly as Step 2 does for the filter itself. Do not
  continue to Step 3.
- **Step 1 does not pre-check the shape.** `csw-batch-filter` already validates it and exits 2
  naming the offending field, and Step 2's existing arm turns that into a failed selection.
  A second shape check here only drifts from the one that matters. Pass the stdout through
  unread and let the filter speak.
- **A command that prints nothing has failed, not found nothing.** Empty stdout hits the
  filter's `no input on stdin` and exits 2, which is a failed selection. A command with nothing
  to report must print `[]`.
- **`tracker` still has to be right.** `trackerCommand` replaces only the fetch;
  `csw-batch-filter` keeps reading `tracker` to rank by priority, so someone shelling out to a
  Linear GraphQL query still sets `tracker: linear` or gets the wrong order silently.
- **It must be read-only.** A dry run reaches Step 1 before it reaches Step 3, so it runs this
  command too — skipping it would leave a dry run with no plan to report. Step 3's "no side
  effects" promise covers CSW's own actions, not what an arbitrary configured command does.

## Step 2: Select

```bash
printf '%s' "$candidates_json" | csw-batch-filter
```

Three filters, none of which is guesswork:

1. **Blocked and not-Todo** tickets are dropped.
2. **Same-surface clusters** keep their highest-priority member. Two tickets on one nav
   surface do not conflict textually, but a same-surface audit rule means the agent doing one
   properly lands in the other's copy.
3. **Single-writer labels** admit one ticket per batch. Two migration-adding tickets each
   write the next number in a global sequence and both regenerate the checksums file; neither
   PR is wrong, both validated against the base, and one still has to be redone rather than
   rebased.

A fourth exclusion, read off the ticket rather than computed by the filter:

4. **A decide-shaped ticket with no answer on it is not dispatched.** Where the description
   asks for a decision — "decide whether", "choose between", "work out what X is for" — and the
   ticket carries no `**CSW prep**` comment, or carries one whose `## Open questions` is not
   `_None._`, move it to `skipped` with that as its reason.

   It is a candidate for `/csw:prep` or `/csw:work interactive`, not for a dispatch at 3am.
   Prep already ends by declaring a ticket dispatchable or not; this is the step that reads the
   verdict, and without it the verdict is computed and thrown away. An unattended dispatch
   handed a decision to make will make one, and nobody agreed to it — the expensive version of
   that is a decision recorded as an ADR, which then has to be corrected by the branch that
   inherits it.

Then the cap — three or four, not the whole column. The ceiling is not the loop, it is
review: preview environments merge every open non-draft PR together, so the morning review
tests the *combination*. Past three or four, a bug found there cannot be attributed without
bisecting, and the review gate is what this whole design rests on.

The cap is not a fourth filter, and the output keeps it separate. Three keys come back:

| Key | Contents |
|---|---|
| `selected` | Dispatching tonight, in dispatch order. |
| `belowCap` | Passed every filter and still fell outside the cap, in the order it would have been dispatched. |
| `skipped` | Genuinely excluded — blocked, not Todo, same-surface cluster, single-writer conflict — each with its reason. |

`belowCap` is never an exclusion, and `skipped` never blames the cap. Keep them apart
everywhere you report them. Merged, nothing downstream can tell "must not run tonight" from
"would have run with a bigger cap" — and those two answer different questions: the first is
tuning data for the exclusion heuristics, the second is an argument for a different cap.

**If `csw-batch-filter` exits non-zero, the batch does not run.** Report its stderr message
verbatim, say plainly that selection failed and no tickets were dispatched, and stop — do not
continue to Step 3. A failed selection is never an empty selection: a malformed ticket, a bad
`priority` type, a duplicate id, or a negative configured cap all exit non-zero with no usable
`selected`/`skipped` on stdout, and none of them mean "nothing eligible tonight."

The optional cap override — $ARGUMENTS — can only lower tonight's cap, never raise it: the
configured `batch.maxTickets` is a safety ceiling, not a default to override upward. To
evaluate it you need that ceiling in hand, so read it the same way Step 1 reads the tracker:

```bash
csw-config get batch.maxTickets
```

Apply the override after the filter returns. If $ARGUMENTS is a positive integer smaller than
the length of `selected`, keep only its first that many entries — `selected` is already in
dispatch order — and move the rest to the **front** of `belowCap`, ahead of the filter's own
entries. They belong there and not in the skip list: nothing excluded them, and they are the
very next tickets that would dispatch if the cap went back up. Front, because they outrank
everything the filter had already put below the cap.

If $ARGUMENTS is absent, not a positive integer, or greater than or equal to the value
`csw-config get batch.maxTickets` just printed, ignore it, say so in the summary, and dispatch
the filter's own `selected` unchanged. Never guess at what a malformed override meant, and
never guess at the configured cap either — read it.

## Step 3: If this is a dry run, report and stop

A dry run answers "what would tonight do?" and nothing else. **It has no side effects:**
no dispatch, no worktree, no branch, no pull request, no change to any ticket's state.
Steps 4 through 7 do not run. The whole value is that it is free to run before an unattended
night, and it is only free while it stays free of side effects.

Report all three groups — the plan is not the selected list alone:

| Section | Contents |
|---|---|
| Would dispatch | Every `selected` id, in dispatch order |
| Below the cap | Every `belowCap` id, in the order it would have been dispatched |
| Excluded, and why | Every `skipped` id with its verbatim reason |

Then state the **effective cap and where it came from** — the configured `batch.maxTickets`,
or tonight's override, naming both the number and which one won. Someone reading this is
deciding whether the cap is right; a bare "cap: 2" does not say whether that came from the
config or from what they just typed.

Then stop. A dry run ends here — there is no go-ahead to give, because nothing is waiting on
one.

**A filter failure in a dry run is a failure, not an empty plan.** Step 2 already stopped if
`csw-batch-filter` exited non-zero; do not print three empty groups underneath it. Three
empty groups mean "nothing was eligible tonight", which is the one thing a failed selection
does not mean.

## Step 4: Confirm the selection

Show all three groups — `selected`, `belowCap`, and every `skipped` entry with its reason —
then wait for a go-ahead. `belowCap` belongs in front of the human here: it is the only
moment where "there were three more ready to go" can still change tonight's cap. This is the
last human checkpoint before an unattended night — once given, Steps 5 through 7 run straight
through with no further prompting and no further confirmation, until the morning summary
reports what happened.

## Step 5: Dispatch each to a fresh subagent, in order

Every selected ticket goes to a **fresh subagent** of its own, dispatched in order, each
running `csw:work` to its hard stop at an open PR. One subagent, one worktree, one PR per
ticket. **Never run `csw:work` in this session.**

This session holds the loop and nothing else: the three groups from Step 2, the row each
dispatch returns, and the morning summary. It must never hold a ticket's plan, its diff, or the
approaches it tried and abandoned — because whatever it holds, the next ticket inherits.
Isolated worktrees driven from one shared context are not isolated dispatches: ticket two is
biased by an approach chosen for ticket one, and a dead end explored at 11pm is still sitting
in context at 2am when nobody is watching. The subagent is the programmatic equivalent of
clearing context before each dispatch, which is the discipline this whole workflow rests on.

### The dispatch

- **A fresh subagent per ticket.** Not a fork: a fork inherits the parent conversation
  wholesale, which is the exact contamination being removed here. It would look like isolation
  and provide none.
- **The brief is the ticket reference and nothing else.** `csw:work` Step 2 reads the ticket
  from the tracker itself, so a reference is a complete brief. Anything else you add is context
  from a different ticket.
- **Synchronously, one at a time, in dispatch order.** The controller needs each result before
  it moves on; a night whose dispatches all land at once is a morning that cannot attribute
  anything.
- **With no worktree isolation on the subagent.** `csw:work` Step 4 creates the worktree itself,
  on the branch `csw-ticket branch` derives from the ticket. A subagent handed an isolated
  worktree at launch is already inside one and cannot create that branch — it would work in an
  auto-named temporary worktree instead, on a branch name that nothing downstream (the PR title,
  `csw:merge`, `csw:cleanup`) knows how to find.

`csw:work` is reachable from inside a subagent because it sets no `disable-model-invocation`:
the subagent invokes it through the Skill tool by name, and it can equally be preloaded into a
subagent definition's `skills` field. Nothing extra has to be installed for this to work.

The reference goes over on its own for a second reason too. `csw:work` takes an `interactive`
modifier that brainstorms the ticket and waits for a human to answer, and at 3am there is
nobody to answer — a ticket parked on an unanswered question is a night that stops on the first
one rather than working the rest. A ticket that genuinely needs the conversation is a ticket for
tomorrow, dispatched by hand. A subagent cannot ask the user anything even if it wanted to, but
do not lean on that: pass the reference alone and the question never arises.

### The report contract

Each subagent returns one structured result and nothing else — no transcript, no plan, no diff:

| Field | Contents |
|---|---|
| `ticket` | The reference that was dispatched |
| `outcome` | `pr`, `draft`, or `failed` |
| `pr` | The pull request URL, or none if it never got that far |
| `summary` | One line on what changed |
| `blocker` | For `draft` and `failed`: the question asked, or what stopped it |
| `coverage` | Every acceptance item accounted for, or which are not — from the ticket's `**CSW scope**` comment |
| `absorbed` | What this dispatch folded in beyond the ticket's own items, one line each, or none |
| `adr` | The ADR the dispatch proposed — its path and its title — or none, which is the usual answer |

`adr` is in the contract because it cannot reach the morning any other way. `csw:work` Step 8
writes the ADR itself when the repo sets `adrDir` — a subagent behaves exactly as a solo run
does, and nothing about the batch is asked to hold back — but Step 7 below assembles the summary
from these rows and Step 2's groups and nothing else. An ADR that is not in the row is an ADR
that merges unnoticed, which is the single way writing them unattended goes wrong.

`coverage` and `absorbed` are in the contract for the same reason. A dispatch that folded three
adjacent fixes into its branch has a larger diff than its ticket describes, and a morning that
cannot see that reviews it as though it were the ticket. Coverage is the other half: it is what
separates a ticket that shipped from a ticket that shipped most of itself, and it is the input
`csw:cleanup` needs before it will propose closure.

That row is all the controller keeps. It is what Step 7 assembles the morning summary from,
which is why the summary is built out of results rather than reconstructed from a transcript.
A subagent that returns prose instead has handed back the transcript problem; record what you
can from it, note that it did not honour the contract, and carry on.

## Step 6: When a ticket blocks or fails

An unattended batch has nobody to ask. So instead of stopping and waiting, the subagent working
the ticket:

1. Writes the question as a comment on the ticket.
2. Pushes a **draft** PR carrying the work so far (`gh pr create --draft`), referencing it.
3. Leaves the ticket In Progress.
4. Returns `outcome: draft` with the question as its `blocker`.

Draft is load-bearing: preview automation filters drafts out, so blocked work survives and
stays reviewable without polluting the environment used to review the PRs that finished. In
Progress is self-excluding, since this loop only pulls Todo — no risk of re-dispatching into
the same wall tomorrow night.

The same applies to any ticket that does not reach merge-ready: failed validation, a partial
implementation, an approach that ran out of road. Draft is the state for "there is work here
worth keeping, but it is not a merge candidate."

The answer then lands in the ticket as durable context, so a re-dispatch starts from a better
brief than the original. The loop compounds rather than merely parallelizes.

**A subagent that fails outright is one row in the summary, not the end of the night.** It
returned `failed`, or it errored, or it came back with nothing usable at all. Record what you
have — the ticket, `failed`, and whatever it said — and dispatch the next ticket. Do not
re-dispatch the one that failed, and do not try to finish its work here: this session has no
worktree, no context, and no business acquiring either. Failure isolation is the point of
dispatching this way, and it is only real if the loop actually keeps going.

## Step 7: Morning summary

Assemble it from the rows Step 5 collected — one per dispatched ticket — plus the three groups
Step 2 returned. That is the whole input, and it is why the night does not have to be
reconstructed by hand across the tracker or read back out of a transcript:

| Section | Contents |
|---|---|
| Dispatched | Every ticket the loop started |
| PRs open | Ticket, PR URL, one line on what changed, and its coverage — the `pr` rows |
| Absorbed work | Ticket, and what the dispatch folded in beyond its own items — the `absorbed` rows, if any |
| Blocked with questions | Ticket, the question asked, the draft PR — the `draft` rows |
| Failed | Ticket and what came back — the `failed` rows, if any |
| ADRs proposed | Ticket, the ADR's path and title — the `adr` rows, if any. Proposed, not decided |
| Below the cap | Every `belowCap` id from Step 2, in order — tonight's queue, not tonight's rejects |
| Skipped and why | Every `skipped` entry from Step 2, verbatim reason |

**ADRs proposed gets its own section, not a note tacked onto a PR row.** An architectural
decision that merges because nobody noticed it in a summary line is the failure this reporting
exists to prevent, and a section is what survives a skim of the morning. Most nights it is
empty, and an empty section says the useful thing too. Each one is a single commit on its PR,
so rejecting it is a revert — say that, so the morning reads them as proposals rather than as
decisions already taken.

**Absorbed work gets a section on the same footing, and for the same reason.** Folding adjacent
work in is what stops a finding costing a whole cycle, and it is also the thing that quietly
grows a diff past what its ticket describes. Each absorption is its own commit, so rejecting one
is a revert — say so, and the morning reads them as proposals too. An empty section says the
useful thing as well: the night found nothing worth absorbing.

If Step 2 failed outright, this table is not the report. Say plainly that selection failed,
quote the filter's message, and that nothing was evaluated or dispatched — never fold a
failed run into an empty Dispatched/Skipped table, which is reserved for a night where
candidates existed and were legitimately skipped.

Then stop. Merging the night's PRs is a morning decision, made by a human looking at diffs.

## Red flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---|---|
| "The column has twelve Todo tickets, dispatch them all" | Three or four. The cap is about attributable review, not throughput. |
| "Two migration tickets, they touch different tables" | They share a global sequence and one checksums file. One per batch. |
| "`blockedBy` is empty, so nothing is blocked" | Empty `blockedBy` usually means an unfilled field. Check before trusting it. |
| "This one's blocked, I'll open a normal PR and note it" | Draft. Always draft. Preview merges non-draft PRs. |
| "I'll merge the PRs that clearly passed" | The morning review is the gate. Do not pre-empt it. |
| "The skip reasons are noise in the summary" | They are the tuning data for the next batch. Report all of them. |
| "csw-batch-filter printed nothing, must mean no tickets were eligible" | Check the exit code first. Non-zero means selection failed — report the failure, don't dispatch nothing and call it a quiet night. |
| "trackerCommand printed nothing, must be a quiet night" | Check its exit code, then remember empty output is a *failed* selection — only `[]` is an empty one. |
| "trackerCommand's output is nearly right, I'll tidy it up" | Then you are doing the in-context reshaping the key exists to avoid. Pass it through; the filter names what's wrong. |
| "They said cap it at 6 tonight, I'll pass that through" | The override can only lower the cap. `batch.maxTickets` is the ceiling; ignore anything at or above it, and say so. |
| "Over the cap is skipped, same table" | Different questions. `skipped` is why a ticket must not run; `belowCap` is what a bigger cap would have picked up. Merged, neither is answerable. |
| "A dry run may as well make the worktrees, they're cheap" | A dry run has no side effects at all. No branches, no worktrees, no ticket state changes — that is the only reason it is safe to run before anything is decided. |
| "The dry run found nothing, quiet night" | Check whether selection *failed*. Three empty groups mean nothing was eligible; a non-zero exit means nothing was evaluated. |
| "I'll just run csw:work here, it's one extra ticket" | Then this session carries that ticket into the next one. Every dispatch is a fresh subagent, without exception. |
| "A fork keeps the context I need" | The context you keep is the contamination. A fork inherits everything; a subagent inherits the reference. |
| "Give the subagent an isolated worktree so it starts clean" | `csw:work` Step 4 makes the worktree, on the branch derived from the ticket. Pre-isolating it strands the work on a name nothing downstream can find. |
| "The subagent stalled, I'll pick up where it left off" | One failure is one row in the summary. Record it and dispatch the next ticket. |
| "I'll paste its transcript into the summary" | The summary is assembled from returned rows. A transcript in the summary is the problem the subagents exist to remove. |
| "The ADR is a detail, it fits in the PR row" | It gets its own section. An ADR nobody noticed is the one way writing them unattended goes wrong. |
| "Nobody was watching, so the subagent should not have written an ADR" | It should. Both paths write; review is the filter, and the ADR is its own commit so rejecting it is one revert. |
